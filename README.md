# Writing an interpreter in go
This is the implementation of monkey lang interpreter that I have 
written as part of reading the book

## TODO
These are the things I am going to do on my own that are not done in the
book since they are out of scope of it

- [ ] Add support for unicode characters
- [ ] Add support for postfix operators
